lecture 66- debugging

Levture 71 The edit page
    - location: contains metainformation about the url, and locaiton of webpage
    assign method: call on the locaiton object, will redirect the to another route

Lecture 73 
    storage event fires only when local storage changes

Lecture 74
    unix epoch midnight 1970, pos integers in ms for after this date, negative for before.

    arrow functions do not bind arguments or the this value

Lecture 85
    - throwing errors using error keyword will give us a stack trace of where the error is coming from
    - helpful when we have nested call, or a large call stack that needs to be parsed
    - catch block only runs when the file throws an error

Lecutre 89 - OOP
    - object oriented programming is the use of classes, instances, constructors inheritnace
    etc to crate a programming paradigm

Lecture 90 - OOP Cont'd
    - constructor uses the new keyword
    new operator
        - generates new empty object for this instances
        - gives us accesss in the constructor function via the this keyword
            - this refers to new empty object
    - convention is to give uppercase to define a constructor function
    - the instance of the constructor is crreated and then the function returns that object as its return value

Lecture 91
    *** thiss minute 13 arrow function don't bind this, so yo ucan use arrow functions w./in methods sometimes, if you want this to bind
    to the parent method, and not to the function when you're calling it

    prototypal inheritance: move up the chain: first look in the the constructor, then look in the prototype properties.

    doesn't matter if you change the prototype after the instance is created,
    in Java, this is different- the prtotypal properties are copied when hte instance is instantiated, js is dif, it's just a reference., so it can change

Lecture 94
    - great discussion of prototypal inheritance beginning around 6' 
    using {} creates a new instance of object, which has a proto property, which has properties and methods on it
    - we  can change properties on the objecet prototype, but that's a terrible idea
    - literal syntax: when the syntax allows us to define a type using characters, ex using 
        *** this is why we don't need to use the new keyword to instantiate a new instance of an object, we can just use curly braces
        ex: saying const product = new Object() is the same as const product = {}

Lecture 95 - primitives and objects part II =focused on 
    everythging that's not a primitive is an object
    - an array is nothing mroe than a customized version of a property
        inheritnace chain: anArray --> Array.prototype --> Object.prototype --> null
        const newArray = new Array(['me', 'you'])

    - when we access methods on a primitive, js wraps the prim in an object wrapper of type string, number, etc.
    - can also instantiante with new String constructor

Lecture 100 - class and subclasses
    - syntactical sugar to create objects of a class
    - use extends keyword to extend a class, then yo uneed to set up the super unction that takes the same asrgs as the parent class

Lecture 101 -getters and setters
    - they come built in, all we do is werite the property like it's a shorthand method, with the keyword get or set before it. 
        - then we assign the set value to a third variable, ususally the same name with an underscore, then we get that variable with the getter
        - OR, we can do whatever we want with it.

Lecture 105 HTTP requests
    - can add query string to request w/ a '?' after the url'
    - async sections are really execllent descriptions, esp 105
    - status codes get sent back by the srever 

Lecture 107 - Callback Abstraction
    - initially, wanted to separate code so that the whole logic behind sending request wasn't in the app file
    - so we separate out into another function, and then call that function in the app file
       *** - but we can't just use return, because the whole function completes executing before
       *** we get the data back from the addeventlistener function, which is listenting to the response from the server we're requeting info from
       so we ues callback pattern. SO 
        - we pass in a callback function into the request function
        - then we call this callback within the listener, after the listener has returned. and then we return the data we got back there, form within listener func

Lecture 108
    - we want async functions when dealing wiht servers, becaues the server can do other things while waiting for the funcition to return
    - request.open can take a third parameter, which is whether or not async func
    *** we lock up the UI with a sync request
    blocking === sync; non-blocking === async

Lecture 110 - Closures
    - if we declare that soething inside the function has access to something outside of its scope via
    lexical scoping, it still has access even after that function retunrs

    via closures, we can create private  vairalbes that we can only interact with thru an api. ex createCounter variable

    currying: the process of changing one function that takes in lots of inputs into multiple functions that take in fewer inputs

Lecture 111 - Promises
    - you can only call resolve/reject once, and only one of them
